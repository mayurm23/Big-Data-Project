# Big-Data-Project
Hard disk drives(HDD) are one of the most common devices in storage systems, and most of the information in the world is being stored on
hard drives. While the failure of a single hard drive might be rare, a system with thousands of hard drives will often experience failures 
and even simultaneous failures, resulting in service unavailability, and even permanent data loss. Therefore, reliability is one of the 
biggest concerns in storage systems.

In this project, we explore the ability of Neural Networks and XGBoost technique to predict hard drive failure based on SMART 
(Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) attributes.
